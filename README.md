This code is a React application that creates an audio synthesizer with a piano keyboard interface. The synthesizer allows you to play notes on the piano keyboard and modify various sound parameters.  
This project stems from my love for music and the nostalgic 90s synthwave.

1. React Components:
   - Piano: This component represents the piano keyboard. It renders the keys based on the notes array, which contains information about the frequency, label, and whether the note is sharp or not. When a key is clicked, it triggers the noteOn function to start playing the corresponding note, and when the key is released (mouse up), it triggers the noteOff function to stop the sound.
   - Synthesizer: This is the main component that wraps the entire synthesizer. It contains sliders and controls for various parameters like volume, waveform type, attack, decay, sustain, release, lowpass frequency, Q value, and delay time. It also renders the Piano component, passing the relevant parameters for sound generation.

2. AudioContext:
   - The code creates an AudioContext object using the Web Audio API. This is the fundamental interface for creating, processing, and managing audio in the application.

3. State and Hooks:
   - The Synthesizer component uses React useState and useRef hooks to manage and store various states:
     - adsr: An object that stores Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release values for the envelope of the sound.
     - width: A state that represents the width effect for the sound.
     - volume: The volume of the sound.
     - waveformType: The type of waveform used in the audio oscillator (sine, square, sawtooth, or triangle).
     - lowpassFrequency: The frequency value for the low-pass filter.
     - Qchange: The Q value for the low-pass filter.
     - delayTime: The delay time for the audio.
     - isPolyMode: A boolean flag that indicates whether the synthesizer is in polyphonic mode or not.
   - The Piano component uses useState to manage the state of active oscillators and whether a note is currently playing (isNoteOn).

4. Audio Generation and Processing:
   - The createOscillator function is responsible for creating and setting up an audio oscillator with various parameters like frequency, waveform type, and detune. It also connects a low-pass filter, gain node (for volume control), and delay node to the oscillator to create the sound.
   - The noteOn function is triggered when a piano key is clicked. It creates three oscillators for the same note, detuned with slight differences, to achieve a more "wide" or "thicker" sound (used for polyphony simulation). It sets the state with the active oscillators and sets isNoteOn to true.
   - The noteOff function is triggered when a piano key is released (mouse up). It stops and disconnects the oscillators and resets the state.

5. Effects and Modifiers:
   - The sound is modified using a low-pass filter, which is connected to each oscillator. The lowpassFrequency and Qchange values are controlled by the sliders in the Synthesizer component.
   - The widthEffect parameter creates detuned oscillators to achieve a wider sound.

6. Polyphonic Mode:
   - The synthesizer can be toggled between polyphonic and monophonic modes using the "Poly On" and "Poly Off" buttons. In polyphonic mode, multiple notes can be played simultaneously, and each note has its set of oscillators. In monophonic mode, playing a new note will stop the previous note.
